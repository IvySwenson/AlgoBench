# AlgoBench
AlgoBench allows users to upload algorithm scripts, run them automatically on sample datasets, and visualize their runtime performance. The goal is to create a web-based system for comparing algorithm efficiency (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms) in an intuitive and visual way.
